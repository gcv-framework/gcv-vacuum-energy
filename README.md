# GCV Framework — Vacuum Energy, Dark Energy, and Testable Null Tests

GR-exact, radiatively stable approach to the cosmological constant (vacuum energy) problem.

This repository provides a high-level entry point to the **Gauged Constant Vacuum-Mode (GCV)**
framework: a GR-exact, radiatively stable approach to the cosmological constant (vacuum energy)
problem with concrete late-time observational tests.

The core idea is that dark energy can be understood as a **geometric integration constant**
rather than a dynamical substance, while strictly constant vacuum contributions are handled
by a global constraint. Local cosmology remains exactly Einstein gravity once Λ_eff is fixed.

## What is testable

• **GR-exact limit:** flat growth relative to GR (ε = 0)  
• **Allowed excitation:** small, smooth downward growth tilt at late times  
• **Falsifier:** large deviations, opposite tilt, or geometry-modifying effects

The framework treats null results as meaningful outcomes.
